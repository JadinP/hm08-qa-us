Sprint Project 8 Test Automation

In this project, we are required to create an automation test for our test application called Urban Routes. The creation of several tests is to check the functionality of Urban Routes. All test cases will be created and tested locally using the following programs. GitHub is an online repository and cloud storage that is used to copy and relay changes for a test project. After obtaining the project temp using the Command line/GitBash you can edit the files provided such as JavaScript, and Text documents for information and instructions. 
 
After obtaining the necessary files and before starting to work on the project, run "npm install" from the console in your project folder. This is to obtain the dependencies for testing for the tests to be worked on and tested with an editing program, Visual Studio code Studio is the program to be used to visually create javaScripts and to launch code for testing with the automated system. WebdriverIO is a modern test framework for automating tests. It uses the WebDriver protocol, which is itself a long-lived automation framework. Selenium WebDriver provides a vast library of methods for browser automation and supports various browsers and browser engines. This program will be able to read and relay the created tests in Urban Routes to verify its functionality. 

When the code lines are added and created in a root folder via Visual Studio Code Studio. The tests are run in the console of VS using the command "npm run wido" This instructs the automation tests created for WebdriverIO to start and run the created tests. After the tests are verified it reports back with passing or errors to help finalize the functionality of an app. Then we report our findings.
